I grew up in Waukesha, Wisconsin.  I majored in Art and graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater in 1972 with a degree in Art Education.  I worked for the Waukesha Freeman in advertising layout.  We moved to central Wisconsin and farmed for nine years.  I worked part-time there doing ad layouts.  In 1977, I saw an article in a magazine on rosemaling.  My mother had taken a rosemaling class, gave me her things and said I would be better at it so I took a class.  We had a bus trip down to the Nordic Fest and there I got to see all the rosemaling.  I loved it and it made me think more about my Scandinavian background, mostly Swedish.  I have since collected many Scandinavian things, decorated my home more Scandinavian, gotten traditional recipes, and looked more into my family history.
 
I started teaching locally in about 1980 in Rogaland.  In 1984 we moved back down to Waukesha and I got involved with the Norse Rosemalers in Milwaukee and WSRA in Stoughton.  I met Vi Thode and Ethel Kvalheim there.  Ethel has been a big influence and encouragement to me over the years.  I first entered Decorah in 1986 and was thrilled to get a ribbon.  The competition was then very hard.  In 1990, after getting my gold medal, I took my first class in Decorah since I felt my children were finally old enough to leave for a week.  Since then, I've taken classes from a number of Norwegian instructors including Nils Ellingsgard and have been to Norway to study.
 
My painting has evolved so much over the years.  I now paint many styles including: Rogaland, Telemark, Valdres, Gudbrandsdal, Os and Hallingdal with much more to learn.  I have taken a number of classes in Acanthus woodcarving.  It is a heritage I can pass down to my family.
