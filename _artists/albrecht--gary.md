Ten years ago, when I told my father-in-law I would take a beginning rosemaling class in order to decorate his log house, I didn't realize the enormous step I was about to take into the wonderful world of this art form.  Now, I can't imagine my life without it.  Also, farthest from my mind, was ever being awarded the Rosemaling Gold Medal of Honor, from Vesterheim, in 1979.

Four years ago, I left business accounting to begin a new career traveling and teaching rosemaling around the country and at Vesterheim.  It has been a most rewarding venture for me and my wife, Renay.  I love spreading the knowledge of its history and techniques.  This winter has been especially busy as I've been preparing a pattern book, which will be released April 1.

As I said, I can√≠t imagine painting not being a part of my life.  It completely surrounds both of our lives now as Renay, too, devotes her time to assisting me with class preparations, backgrounding, and the like.  We enjoy traveling to the National Society of Tole and Decorative Painter's Conventions, where I also teach.  This gives us the pleasure of meeting artists from other facets of the art work and seeing their works.

When we are not rosemaling, you are most likely to find us at a dog show with one of our four dogs.  We love volunteering time to help out at the local humane society in Madison, WI, where we live.  Traveling for pleasure and theatergoing are also high on our list of priorities.  But, somehow, rosemaling always edges back to the forefront of what we enjoy most, just getting together with our rosemaling friends and talking shop.
