### Artist Statement

Involvement in Norwegian-American folk art began when I was kidnapped, brainwashed, and indoctrinated by Norsekie-phile Martians. Perhaps you jump to the conclusion that I possess an I-identity, or perhaps it is I-identity or as close as I’ll get to one. My art has been most influenced by Otto Nygaard and brain damage.
