My grandmother came to the United States with her parents from Norway.  She married and had several children.  My father was 8 years old when she died.  Through the years most of the Norwegian heritage was lost or forgotten.  I wish I could have known her.

I had not had any formal art training, but was always interested in folk art.  In the early 1960's, I went to a folk painting class with a local artist.  She had some rosemaling experience and talked about classes she had taken at Vesterheim.  Years later after our daughters were in school, I enrolled in a rosemaling class at our local technical school.  That was the beginning of a great experience that I still totally enjoy.

Thanks to Vesterheim, Wisconsin State Rosemalers in Stoughton, WI, Norse Rosemalers in Milwaukee, and Illinois Norsk Rosemalers, I have had a great opportunity to study with many American and Norwegian artists.  Trudy Peach has been a great influence in my painting.  She taught us how to study the old painted pieces to find new ideas, and to learn techniques.  She also was helpful in showing us how to design a pattern.  Judy Kjenstad was also a great help to me.  She helped me understand how to design to fit the piece we were painting.

Entering my work in the rosemaling shows was a good learning experience.  Twelve years after my first entry at Vesterheim, I was honored to have earned enough points to receive the Vesterheim Gold Medal in Rosemaling.
 
I usually paint in the Agder style, but have also done Rogaland, Numedal, and Hordaland styles.

I am so grateful to have had this rosemaling experience and to do something in touch with my heritage.
