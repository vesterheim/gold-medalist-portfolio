1.  How did you get involved in your field of Norwegian folk art?

I felt an intuitive pull in 1996 to try folk art at North House.

2.  Does Norwegian folk art speak to your identity? In what why?

My heritage is Scandinavian and I always enjoyed folk art. 

3.  Who or what has influenced your art the most? 

There are multiple instuctures that have influenced me both at North House and at Vesterheim. I am gratefule to Harley Rofsol, Gene Tokheim, and Phil Odden to name a few.
