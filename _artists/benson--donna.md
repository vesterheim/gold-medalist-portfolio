I grew up in Chicago and spent a lot of time with all of my Swedish grandparents.  My interest in handicrafts and traditions was apparent, even as a child.  I learned to sew and knit early on, but it was in 1974 when my husband, Bill, and I traveled up to Door County, Wisconsin on a short vacation that painting came into my life.  Vi Thode happened to be demonstrating her Rogaland-style painting outside of a Swedish restaurant, Al Johnson's, in Sister Bay, WI.  I was totally taken with her painting and bought her Beginning Rosemaling book.  Bill and I are both of Swedish descent, but, none the less, I was immediately hooked on Norwegian rosemaling.  Finding local teachers was not easy, so I began taking classes at Vesterheim in Decorah.  I have studied all of the different styles of rosemaling, but Hallingdal became my favorite and it was in this style that I won my Gold Medal in 1997.  I also have studied Swedish folk art and teach it as well.

I get a lot of inspiration from books about rose painting and wood carving.  I sometimes just pick up one small detail in a picture that eventually becomes a complete design.  Nils Ellingsgard's books are certainly worth a thousand words!  I have painted many large pieces of furniture, trunks, and recently, built-in Norwegian beds and corner cabinets in homes.  After all of these years, I still love the art of rosemaling!
