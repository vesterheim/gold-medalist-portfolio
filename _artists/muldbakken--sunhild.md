I got interested in rosemaling after visiting Norway in 1968 and started to take lessons in 1971.  My husband is from Valdres, Norway and I have always been interested in art in general.  I found rosemaling very pleasing and have always enjoyed painting flowers and scrolls.  The teachers that have influenced me the most are Sigmund Aarseth and Nils Ellingsgard.  I also have learned a lot from Bergljot Lunde and Alfhild Tangen. 

I started to teach rosemaling in 1973 in an evening adult ed class in Sioux Falls.  I traveled to many small towns in South Dakota teaching rosemaling from 1976 - 1984.  These classes were sponsored by the South Dakota Arts Council and National Endowment for the Arts.  I have since taught throughout the U. S. 

Rosemaling has been my profession the last 36 years.  I do mostly commission work.  I have also taught some rosemaling classes at Vesterheim.  I am best known for my Telemark style of rosemaling, but I also teach Valdres, Hallingdal, and the Gudbrandsdal styles.  I enjoy painting on larger pieces - trunks, bowls, cabinets and furniture.
