When I got interested in woodcarving and started concentrating on chip carving, the aspect of design as a way of embellishing wooden objects was a strong influence and driver. Soon, I became aware of the great and long history of this carving method that reaches into Norwegian craftsmanship. Many of the designs used by early Norwegians have tremendous graphic detail and I find it very challenging to try to duplicate and use them as a basis for some of my own designs. It amazes me the precision shown in many early Norwegian carvings with the tools that were available in those times.
 
I try to mix the designs from many sources in my work, however I find Norwegian art and carving designs to be a constant resource of ideas. I also like many of the Norwegian furniture designs and draw upon those as inspiration for some of my projects on which I add chip carving.
 
In 1999 I took a chip carving advanced class with Mr. Wayne Barton. That class and his encouragement were, and still are, great influences on my carving. Participating in the juried _National Exhibition_ at Vesterheim has also been a large influence. It has encouraged me oto constantly strive to produce good work that is accepted by the international judges. Attaining a level of recognition by being awarded the Vesterheim Gold Medal is a continual source of pride and accomplishment for me.
