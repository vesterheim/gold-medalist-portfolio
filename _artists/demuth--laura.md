### Artist Statement

I was born in Pennsylvania in 1956, and moved with my family approximately every-other year between Europe and the United States during my childhood years. I came to Decorah in 1976 to attend Luther College and have remained in the area since that time. I live on a small acreage just seven miles northeast of Decorah with my husband, a small flock of Bluefaced Leicester sheep, and two dogs. I spent much of my adult years home-educating our two now-adult children, while also tending our gardens and orchard. I love having fiber in my hands, whether it is raw fleece, combed top, yarn, or a woven textile. I also enjoy teaching weaving and knitting to both beginners and more experienced textile artists.

I have always been drawn to the beauty and skill found in traditional textiles. So while I am not aware of any Norwegian ancestry in my family, I greatly appreciate Vesterheim’s wonderful textile collection as a source of learning and inspiration. I began taking classes at Vesterheim in the 1990s, and learned to improve my general weaving skills while focusing on particular techniques such as _rya_ blankets and double weave pick-up. I especially enjoy the challenge of creating designs, mastering new techniques, and using handspun yarns in Norwegian textiles.
