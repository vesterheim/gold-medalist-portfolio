My interest in Norwegian knives started long ago when my neighbor received a Norwegian knife from his Grandfather. His grandfather had gone to Norway and returned with knives for his grandsons.

On my first visit to Norway I purchased knives for my two sons too. I didn’t buy one for myself but decided to make my own.

It’s been a very adventurous hobby for me.

Knife making is a big hobby in Norway. Making knives helps define my Norwegian roots.

Gene Tokhiem has been a steady influence. Entering the Folk Art Competition and taking classes at Vesterheim has also influenced my art form.
