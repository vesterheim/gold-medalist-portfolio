While decorative painting in 1982, I was introduced to rosemaling when Gary Albrecht came to Moline to teach a seminar.  From that very first class, my love for the art blossomed.  Rosemaling and Vesterheim opened up a whole new world of fascinating experiences, including a reception at the White House, and introduced me to wonderful new friends in the U.S., Canada, and in Norway.

Five intensive study trips to Norway provided instruction with many of Norway's finest teachers.  These study trips and visits to Vesterheim immerse one into the Norwegian culture and arts and create a yearning to learn more and more about rosemaling as well as the Norwegian culture.

My special interest lies in the Telemark rosemaling style; and studying the works of old Masters Hans Glittenberg, Nikuls Buine, Knut Mevasstaul, and Thomas Luraas, along with current teachers Gold Medalist Marlys Hammer and Norway's Nils Ellingsgard, Ragnvald Fr¯ysdal, and Kari Petersen have most influenced my painting style.  My studies resulted in my writing and publishing an award-winning instructional book in 2004 on Telemark rosemaling, Rosemaling Heirlooms of Tomorrow, The Complete Guide to Shaded Telemark Style Norwegian Rosemaling.

Until 2000, I worked full-time so it was difficult to find the time to paint.  But my family was very encouraging and tolerant of my need for creative fulfillment, and I found the time because it was had become an inherent part of my life.  Now that I am retired I have more precious time to paint, design, write and teach this beautiful art that, after my faith, my family and friends, has come to define who I am.  Rosemaling decorates my home and it decorates my life.  My deepest gratitude goes to Vesterheim for planting the roots of rosemaling deep within my soul.

God has truly blessed this marvelous journey.
