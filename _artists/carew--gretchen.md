I began studying Rosemaling in 1982.  A weekly class being taught by a decorative painter in Tucson, Arizona introduced me to rose painting using Vi Thode's method of painting.  Later I became involved and active in the Nordland Rosemaling Association in Grand Forks, North Dakota.  The Association sponsored many teachers from Norway and the U.S. to teach in Grand Forks.  In 1986 I attended the Nordland Rosemaling Association trip to Norway to visit many rosemaling artists and folk museums. The following year, 1987, I joined Vesterheim's Folk Art Workshop in Voss, Norway.  The teachers were Gunnar B¯  and Nils Ellingsgard.

Six later trips with Vesterheim provided a rich education in Norwegian folk art by those present day Norwegian painters still practicing today.   The Hallingdal regional style and Master folk artist and historian, Nils Ellingsgard, has been the most influential for me.  I love bold color and appreciate symmetry in design. These qualities mark the Hallingdal style as my favorite.   Since first exhibiting in the 1992 Vesterheim Folk Art Exhibition, the yearly process of designing and painting two special items resulted in growth and proficiency.  Being awarded a Gold Medal in 2007 was a special reward to hard work and perseverance.  Thanks to Vesterheim for sponsoring the exhibition and workshops in Norway.
