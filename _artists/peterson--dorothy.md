### Artist Statement

"Rosemaling" arrived in 1967 when my husband, Theron, attended a craft show. He encouraged me to attend a class. He thought I could learn everything in a week! Being Norwegian, it took me a longer time as I am still attending classes. In 1969 I entered the rosemaling exhibition in Decorah, receiving two White Ribbons, and took part in Nils Ellingsgard's class. How brave I was! And, how naive! This experience opened a whole new world and I was "on the road again" for every class and new teacher the museum offered. My mother lived in Westby, Wisconsin, and I would squeeze in a class every time I visited her. Rosemaling not only broadened my interest in art, it took me to 10 different states to teach, trips to judge rosemaling shows, five trips to Norway, and an invitation to teach at Vesterheim.

Sharing my experiences and knowledge with others has been my greatest satisfaction. The Hallingdal style is my favorite. The past years of experience have broadened my knowledge of different techniques and designs. In the past year I have taught classes in styles found in Osterdalen, Os-Hordaland, and Nordland, and the style of Gunnar Bø.
