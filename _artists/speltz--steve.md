### Artist Statement

I was born and raised in Rollingstone, Minn. I spent most of my childhood wanting to be a carpenter. I have spent most of my adult life working in woodworking. My wife Pat and I own Custom Hardwoods. We build cabinets, furniture, and mill work for a living. At some point, and I don't know exactly when, I started carving for enjoyment, which led to taking classes. I had hoped it might lead to doing and incorporating it in my cabinets and furniture. This I assure you I do very little of as I think it is not something people regularly do these days or can afford. However, I will keep trying to get people to see the value in keeping this alive.
