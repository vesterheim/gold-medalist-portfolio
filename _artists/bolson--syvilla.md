I am a native of Joice, Iowa, but have been living in Decorah, Iowa, for many years. My degree is from Luther College with additional studies through University of Iowa. I have been weaving since 1973. I’ve studied with American Nacy Harvey, Finnish-Canadian Pirkko Karvonen, and Norwegians Elsa Bjork, Marit Anny Tvenge, Anne Holden, Liv Bugge, Ase Froysedal, and Greta Bodogaard. 

My work has been exhibited at many invitational and solo shows, including five solo shows at Luther College, my alma mater. I’ve enjoyed doing commission work to hang in private homes and public buildings in the Midwest and West. “Windows of Learning” is at Luther College (Koren Hall) and “Creation” is in the Methodist Church in Caledonia, Minnesota. One of my most recent commissions, titles “Wondrous Cross,” hangs in the chapel of the Knute Nelson Memorial Home in Alexandria, MN. 

My special interest in weaving reflects the Norwegian tradition. With my background and keen interest in Norwegian art history including folk art, it is exciting to study techniques that have been used for hundreds of years, both of utilitarian and decorative purposes. Tradition and skills have been passed from one generation to the next, even though something new may have been created as an extension of what others had made.

One of my objectives is to create a desire among viewers to be curious about and become responsive to the history of folk art in Norway. I am excited by design, color, and texture and my goal is to create attractive and artistic work.
