### Artist Statement

My rosemaling journey probably had its start by being born in Stoughton, Wisconsin, to a Norwegian father and a Swiss mother. I moved to California when I was 10 years old, but have always called Wisconsin my home. While growing up, many Norwegian traditions were taught and rosemaling played a big part in the decoration of our home. In 1998, my life took a sharp turn and I realized I needed to find a hobby. Having never taken any type of art class, I went to a local craft shop and took a beginning decorative painting class. I knew from the beginning I wanted to learn to do rosemaling. Not finding rosemaling being taught near me I discovered Vesterheim Museum. The rest as they say is history. I have had the opportunity to take many classes with American and Norwegian teachers. I also participated in the 2007 Vesterheim folk-art tour to Norway. There are many teachers and organizations that have contributed to my being able to achieve my goal of becoming a Vesterheim Gold Medalist. I am thankful they have shared, and continue to share, their knowledge with me. The best part of this journey has been the many people I have met and the friendships that have formed along the way.
