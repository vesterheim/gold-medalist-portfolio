Proud to say I am a farmer’s daughter from the beautiful hills of southwest Wisconsin. Early influences were: growing up in a Norwegian American family, Five Points Church, taking a couple art classes and developing a curiosity for Norway. After working my way through college, married a farm boy and we started on an adventure that has lasted for over 43 years. We raised our two beautiful daughters on farms and we collect and restore horse drawn vehicles. Applying line-work to the carriages and sleighs has helped my line-work in rosemaling and I still stripe many vehicles each year. 

Through carriages I came to know a couple rosemalers, Verna Theige and Dorothy Peterson. Both encouraged me to “get to Vesterheim and take classes.” My Grandma Olson had encouraged me to rosemale by getting me the Pat Virch book, and I “attempted” to rosemale but needed a formal class to learn the right way. I attended Nordic Fest and watched mesmerized as Sigmund painted in his flowing Telemark style and I was hooked! So in 1981, I took a class from Addie Pittelkow (who was the perfect beginner’s teacher), without patterns, and I was off and painting everthing I could. 

Other teachers who have also influenced me include: Sigmund Aarseth, Jean Giese, Marlys Hammer, Karen Jensen, Oscar Kjetsja, Irene Lamont, Carl Heinz Meschbach, Dorothy Peterson, Patti Goke, Judy Ritger, Nancy Schmidt, Alfild Tangen, Norma Wangsness, and Barn Wolter. But the ones who truly have influenced me are the old masters of Norway whose rosemaling has been preserved so well. 
After the girls were through college, I was able to “paint my way” to Norway several times and I enjoyed searching out great old rosemaled artifacts in museums and private homes. I am now retired from working in flower shops and am sort of a full time volunteer here in the Westby area. Being grandparents and traveling is a great part of being retired also. 

Of course I belong to the Coulee Region Rosemalers, a group of great folks who share a love of painting. There are many woodcarvers in this area so I work with them often on projects. Monroe Johnson even loaned me he tools to carve a few ale bowls and I was able to earn my gold medal with my first one. It is fulfilling to make an object and then rosemale it. And I still have all my fingers intact! 

Since getting my gold medal in 2009 I still enter the National Folk Art Exhibition, and enjoy painting on old objects (or making them look old) and was thrilled to get a couple People’s Choice awards. Vesterheim has made it possible for many people like myself to realize a dream of being a rosemaler and exploring the culture and heritage of Norway. And the best part of this venture is all the wonderful folks I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know.
I truly appreciate all the great mentors…so many have taken me under their wings, starting with Dorothy Peterson back in 1970’s (I’m still there!). I think a rosemaler is a combination of all the influences absorbed. If takes a village to raise a child, and it takes a lot of mentors to create a rosemaler.
