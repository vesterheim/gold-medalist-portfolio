Harley Refsal (b. 1944) grew up on the farm near Hoffman, Minnesota homesteaded by his Norwegian immigrant grandparents.  A woodcarver since the l960s, he has been teaching workshops and seminars throughout North America since the early 1980s—and later, also in Scandinavia.  He is especially known as a torchbearer and popularizer of what has become known as ‘Scandinavian-style flat-plane figure carving’.  He moved to Decorah in 1972 to work at Luther College, where he held a number of different administrative positions and also taught courses in Norwegian language and culture.  He holds the title Professor Emeritus of Scandinavian Folk Art.

A charter member of Caricature Carvers of America, he has researched and written 5 books and numerous book chapters and magazine articles on Scandinavian figure carving, and has served as invited guest curator for a number of exhibitions.  In 1996 he was decorated by the King of Norway, receiving the St. Olav Medal, for his contributions to Norwegian folk art--especially figure carving--in Norway as well as in North America.  In 2012 Refsal was named Woodcarver of the Year by Woodcarving Illustrated Magazine, and he has also been featured in the PBS Peabody-Award winning television series, Craft in America.
