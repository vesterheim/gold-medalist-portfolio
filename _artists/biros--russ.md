### Artist Statement

Growing up in northern Wisconsin in a community with a large Scandinavian population, I've been exposed to the beauty of Norwegian-style decoration all my life. I started carving about 25 years ago, carving mostly fish and birds. After many years of wildlife carving I needed a change. Seeing the work of Philip Odden and Else Bigton, I decided to try acanthus-style carving. I took a class from Philip and Else and they started me on my journey to a Vesterheim Gold Medal. They have been friends and mentors for many years, and I will always be grateful for their help and encouragement.
