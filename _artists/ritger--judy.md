When we moved to River Falls, WI in l976, I decided to learn the art of rosemaling (as suggested by my good friend, Marlys Hammer).  We took many classes together both through vocational school here in town and mainly at Vesterheim.  I am an occupational therapist by training, but decided not work in that field after our move.  I  have always loved art projects and even though I am not Norwegian (English and German), rosemaling held a special draw for me.  My grandfather painted very well, mainly painting scenes of our homes and animals and I so admired his work when he would come to our home to stay for a month or so.  I was about 6 years old and would sit next to him at the kitchen table and try to draw like he did.  My parents then encouraged me to draw and paint as much as possible- on the walls of our house even!  I painted angels going up the staircase and elves on the kitchen wall.  But then our 4 children and work as a therapist came along and I didn't get back to painting until we moved to River Falls.
I had the opportunity to study on 3 of the Folk Art tours sponsored by Vesterheim and have entered the Nordic Fest competitions for as long as I can remember!  My husband was a professional bowler and traveled all over the world with his bowling and teaching of the sport.  I traveled with him on many exciting trips after our 4 children were off on their own.  These trips gave me the opportunity to work on art projects while he was busy teaching and opened up many different avenues of art.  But rosemaling always stayed a top priority with me, and I kept very busy producing my pieces.  I began teaching rosemaling in l990 (I think) and loved being able to meet so many rosemalers that way.  


My statement for carving:

I had been doing lots of rosemaling after we moved to River Falls, WI and taking as many classes as I could.  My husband was a professional bowler and traveled all over the world teaching the sport.  I went to Australia with him many times and decided that I needed something special to do while he was busy.  Since the weather was conducive to being outdoors a lot, I decided to take along some wood and learn figure carving - which I did!  I bought some basic knives and just learned on my own - using Harold Enlow's book on carving.  Then on one of the Folk Art study tours Ragnavold Froysadal taught me how to do kolrosing and that led me into a whole other area.  I produced a DVD/video called "Kolrosing: Reviving a Lost Art" and taught many classes.  Of course there are so many types of carving that one can get into and I tried most of them.  There is a very strong link between rosemaling and all the Norwegian arts, and even though I am not of Norwegian descent, i really love all the art that comes from that wonderful country.  I still do both painting and carving and often combine the two arts on the same piece - love trying to be creative that way!
