It was through the knowledge that my maternal great grandmother was a gifted and proficient weaver in Tydal, Norway that my interest in weaving was sparked. 
I feel my weaving brings back a tradition that had been lost over the years. This was an art form that began years ago in Tydal, Norway. Due to immigration and establishing a home here in America weaving was not an interest of my grandmother or mother. 
My first introduction to weaving was the owners of the Silks and Yarn Store in Fargo, ND. I took several beginning classes in weaving at her shop.
My brother, Aaron Swenson, built two looms for me. One of the looms he built was a counterbalance loom pattered after a Glimakra (Swedish loom). 
I began weaving and felt I needed more instructions. I heard of Syvilla Bolson in Decorah, IA. She offered classes in her home. I became a regular student of hers.
I attended many weaving classes at Vesterheim Folk Art School form both local and Norwegian weavers. 

Due to a strong Norwegian influence and being able to speak and understand the language I enjoy the Folk Art of Norwegian weaving.

My husband has been a big influence in my art form. He remodeled part of our barn into a weaving studio for me. He is an encourager, helper, and has a great knowledge about repairing and building looms. 

Breif biographical statement:
I have been weaving since the mid 1980s. Over the years I have held classes for weaving in my studio. I have exhibited and received numerous awards. I have demonstrated weaving and felting of wool fibers at various shows. I have exhibited woven pieces at Concordia College in Moorhead, MN and the Hjemkomst Heritage Center in Moorhead, MN. I have sold many of my pieces of weaving and done woven pieces on order.
