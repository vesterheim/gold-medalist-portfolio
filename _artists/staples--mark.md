I had been doing a little woodworking when, in 1999 my sister, Joanne MacVey came for a visit. She challenged me to try to make an ambar. After much experimenting I presented my ambar and received her seal of approval. At that point a whole new world opened to me. Although I am not Norwegian heritage I admired the beauty and skill of the work. I studied pieces at the Vesterheim Museum and also museums in Norway. I wanted to keep my pieces as authentic as possible. 

I entered the Nordic Fest competition at Vesterheim the first time in 2005. This was not am ambar but a replica of the Borgund Stave Church. I received a white ribbon and Peopleâ€™s Choice that year. After that my entries were either ale cups or ambars. I received my Gold Medal in 2013.
