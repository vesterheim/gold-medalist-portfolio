### Artist Statement

I had been doing a little woodworking when, in 1999, my sister Joanne MacVey came for a visit. She challenged me to try to make an _ambar._ After much experimenting I presented my _ambar_ and received her seal of approval. At that point a whole new world opened to me. Although I am not of Norwegian heritage, I admired the beauty and skill of the work. I studied pieces at Vesterheim Museum and also museums in Norway. I wanted to keep my pieces as authentic as possible. 

I entered the _National Exhibition of Folk Art in the Norwegian Tradition_ at Vesterheim for the first time in 2005. This was not an _ambar,_ but a replica of the Borgund Stave Church. I received a White Ribbon and People’s Choice Award that year. After that my entries were either ale cups or _ambars._ I received my Gold Medal in 2013.
