Rosemaling speaks to my roots as I practically lived with my second-generation Norwegian grandparents who lived on our farm. I had previously taken classes on calligraphy and sewing before beginning painting in 1977. I have studied with many Norwegian and Gold Medalist painters, including Oskar Kjetsaa, Nils Ellingsgard, Gunnar Bø, John Gundersen, Dorothy Peterson, Karen Jenson, and Addie Pittelkow. I have enjoyed my association with Scandinavian handcrafts as a rosemaling sales outlet and great rosemaling input!
