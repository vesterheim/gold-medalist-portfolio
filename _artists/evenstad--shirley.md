Rosemaling speaks to my roots as I practically lived with my second-generation Norwegian grandparents who lived on our farm.  I had previously taken classes on calligraphy and sewing before beginning painting in 1977.  I have studied with many Norwegian and Gold Medalist painters, including: Oskar Kjetsaa, Nils Ellingsgard, Gunnar B¯, John Gundersen, Dorothy Peterson, Karen Jenson, and Addie Pittelkow.  I have enjoyed my association with Scandinavian Handcrafts as a rosemaling sales outlet and great rosemaling input!
