For as long as I can remember, I have always loved to create any  kind of art.   After I saw rosemaling demonstrated,  I started taking classes at the Technical College right about the same time I started dating my future husband  so he always knew what he was getting into!    

I entered my first show in Stoughton with the encouragement of my first rosemaling teacher.  After marriage,  I moved to Seymour, WI and took classes at the Technical College in Green Bay where I  also taught and was a charter member of the Green Bay Rosemaling Club.  While my  four children were small  I did  just enough rosemaling to keep my hand in.  As they grew, my husband, a high school teacher, would  either stay home with them or we all went camping  while I took  classes in either Milwaukee or Stoughton.  I was interested in the  Hallingdal style but no one locally was teaching it  so I used my show critiques as a learning tool.  I took one of Judy Ritger's Gudbrandsdal classes  to  improve my linework not knowing what I was getting into -- the designs and elegance  left me speechless! 

When I was finally able to attend classes in Decorah, I started with a Gudbrandsdal class.  Ragnvald Froysadal became  one of my most influential teachers. I still hear  him in my head  when I paint.  Since that first class in Decorah I have returned many times and studied with most of the Norwegian teachers as well as most of the American Gold Medalists.  As a result, I rosemal most  styles although my  favorites are still Hallingdal, Gudbrandsdal, Rococo and Valdres.   Along the way I also began painting  Swedish Dala and Russian Zhostovo.  

My ancestry is not Norwegian but Polish-German so my roaming all over the global Folk Art world is fitting.  One of the things I have learned from my travels and cross cultural friendships is that folk art has no  cultural or time-line boundaries.  All people in every age  have always looked for ways to beautify their  surroundings and everyday tools.  I once found a simple rosemaling border on a Hohokam  pottery bowl in a museum in Arizona!   Thousands of years , an ocean apart and yet their artistic ideas are linked. It was an eye opening moment in my appreciation of the place folk art has in the human heart!  Rosemaling and teaching it, whether it be at the local Tech College, anywhere in the US or Japan,   helps me feel this human connection to artisans  everywhere who  seek beauty and fulfillment in their work.  The people and friendships I have made as a result of this have enriched me, and my family,  beyond measure.
