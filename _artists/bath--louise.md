### Artist Statement

I graduated as a Medical Lab Technologist and worked at the Children’s Hospital in Vancouver. I met my husband, Murray, in Vancouver as he was finishing a Master’s Degree in Metallurgy and followed him to South Africa where we married. We saw many countries over the years: U.K., France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Mauritania, South Africa, Australia, Canada, Dominican Republic, and finally Denver, Colorado. Murray worked for many mining companies and eventually I retrained myself as a Medical Lab Technician and worked at a hospital in Denver for 20 years. 

Murray and I are now retired and are busy with gardening, traveling, and our hobbies. Murray has set up a woodworking shop in our basement. His latest projects involve bending wood for baskets and boxes in authentic Scandinavian styles. I have been rosemaling for the last 20 years and now am teaching it in a Sons of Norway Lodge here in Denver. I have often traveled to Vesterheim in Iowa and taken painting courses there. We drove around Norway three years ago and drank in the culture. By the way we are not Norwegian! I also have been taking classes in botanical illustration and art from the Denver Botanic Gardens. I will never be a famous botanical artist but I have fun with the classes and am lucky to live near such a good program. Also I enjoy gardening. I have many perennials, roses, and raised vegetable beds, but I’m still happy when winter comes and the garden goes to sleep.
