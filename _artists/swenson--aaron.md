First of all, I should say, my twin Arvid & I are equals, as we have worked togather our whole life as building contractors, which our father had also been. Due to his health we took over at an early age. We still live on the farm our parents built and lived since 
age two.

We grew up in a close Norwegian extended family, speaking both Norwegian & English, which has been an asset, especially traveling in Norway. We have visited Norway seven times.

We have always had a strong interest in our heritage; 31 times at Host Fest in Minot, ND, Nordic Fest in Decorah, IA, and Hjemkomst in Moorhead, MN. 

We have had a strong interest in Folk-art, which had a big boost when Robert Asp’s Viking ship came out of the potato house in Hawley, MN.

How we got into carving?  
A long story: Han Ola  go  Han Per  [cartoons in Decorah post] are responsible for us taking our first carving class at Vesterheim and it grew from there.

We have one sister Jeanine who has a Gold Medal in weaving from Vesterheim.

We have a Norwegian room att. to our house, set up as they lived in one room in 1700’s Norway, furnished with replica furniture built by us & painted mostly by Karen Jenson, this room also has a Huldra bed.

The first year we went to country school, in a one room schoolhouse. We only spoke Norwegian and the teacher thought as twins we had our own language, but it was only Norwegian! I think that first year all we did was draw houses and animals.

We have never had any formal training in Norwegian, but are self-taught and can read and write it. We graduated fro Twin Valley High School. 

Most of the figure carving I have done has been based on historic Norwegian caricature.

We started helping with building at age twelve, so you can say we have worked with wood all our lives.

Carol Juven [Mr. Norway of Fargo, ND] stated, “Swenson Twins are more Norwegian then Romme  Grot!

I did have two pieces in the Vesterheim  traveling  exhibit, Migration of a Tradition with a little biography by Marion Nelson.

My twin  brother and I have been self-employed  as building contractors for over 50 years. The last 20 years I have built reproductions, as a hobby, of old Scandinavian pieces, like  cabinets, Swedish mora clocks, beds, Norwegian floor clocks, etc. Which have been
mostly painted by Karen Jenson.

In 1993 or so, we were interviewed  by Garrison  Keillor  at  Museum’s Jacobson  Farm for CBS Sports  & the Lillehammer  Winter Olympics. The clip was never televised, thanks to the two feuding ice skaters, but the video is in the Vesterheim archives.
