Prior to my painting days, I had always dreamed of having a hobby that would be somewhat unique and creative.  During the summer of 1970, I found out about rosemaling from the vo-tech teacher.  She showed me through her home and when I left I was so excited to learn how to paint that I could hardly wait until the class began in October.  Once class started, I practiced every afternoon during naptime.  Fortunately all my children slept from after lunch until 3:30 or 4:00!

The first annual Norse Rosemaling Show was held at Hales Corners, WI in January 1971.  I entered three pieces and got three ribbons.  My vo-tech teacher was very encouraging and told me about the classes offered at Vesterheim in Decorah.  I signed up for the class in May 1971, taught by Nils Ellingsgard.  I came home filled with renewed enthusiasm.  I can't say enough good things about the fantastic experience I have had because of the museum and the time spent studying with Nils and Ruth Nordbo.

I entered every possible show and got encouraging critiques.  In 1972, I entered two pieces in the Nordic Fest.  One received an honorable mention and one got a red ribbon, which gave me my first two points towards the Gold Medal.  As George and I were leaving Decorah, I recall jokingly saying that if I would get two blues the next year I could get my Gold Medal.  In 1973, I entered a bookcase that had once belonged to my grandma and a secretary desk that I had bought at a yard sale exactly 30 days before the deadline for getting things entered in the show.  To my surprise, each piece had a blue ribbon hanging beside it as I walked into the display area.

Rosemaling has played a very important role in my life since I began in 1969.  I will always be grateful for all the encouragement from my vo-tech teacher, family, friends, and especially Vesterheim for offering the rosemalers such wonderful instruction through the years.
