I have been weaving for close to 40 years. After all of this time, each warp is still a challenge with its own set of problems to be solved. Each item from my loom is one of a kind and each is designed to solve a new problem. This approach keeps the process of designing and weaving from becoming an automatic procedure. For me, the designing and successful execution of a textile is far more interesting than the finished product. One of my beginning students once commented, "weaving requires the use of both sides of the brain."
